The Dimensionality Reduction and Recommendation System Using SVD project demonstrates how Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) simplifies large datasets by reducing dimensions while preserving important information. It is applied to extract key features and build recommendation systems. This technique improves performance, reduces noise, and enhances data interpretation in applications like collaborative filtering and data compression.
